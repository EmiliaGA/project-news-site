# News Site

Created a simple version of a news site as a minor project before my technigo web development course started. 

## The problem

Practised using HTML, CSS (including Box Model, Grid and Flexbox), how to create responsive design for mobile, tablets and desktop. Also got a chance to practice writing good code.
Flexbox, Grid and responsive design was the biggest issue for me, but with a bunch of different youtube instructions I sort of got the hang of it and am now eager to learn more. If I had more time I would have done more about the design of the news site to make it more appealing for the eye!

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
