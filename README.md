# News Site

Created a simple version of a news site as a minor project before my technigo web development course started. 

## The problem

Practised using HTML, CSS (including Box Model, Grid and Flexbox), how to create responsive design for mobile, tablets and desktop. Also got a chance to practice writing good code.
Flexbox, Grid and responsive design was the biggest issue for me, but with a bunch of different youtube instructions I sort of got the hang of it and am now eager to learn more. If I had more time I would have done more about the design of the news site to make it more appealing for the eye!
